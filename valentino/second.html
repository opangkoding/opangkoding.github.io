            My eternal sunshine,<br><br>
            Your message wrapped itself around my heart like the warmest embrace. 
            I could feel every word, every tremble of your joy, and it made my own heart glow in ways 
            I can’t even describe. Knowing that I could make you feel that happy—knowing that you chose me 
            with such certainty and love—means more than you will ever know.<br><br>
            I wasn’t just smiling when I read your message; I was completely undone. 
            You have this tenderness, this lightness, this magic that turns the simplest moments 
            into memories I want to hold forever. Being your Valentine isn’t just an honor—it’s the 
            sweetest gift life has placed in my hands.<br><br>
            You call me your sunshine, but the truth is, you are the warmth that reaches me even on my 
            quietest, hardest days. You are the reason I look forward to tomorrow. 
            The way you feel, the way you love, the way you simply are—I adore it all.<br><br>
            Thank you for loving me with such sincerity, for choosing me, and for letting me into your 
            beautiful heart. I promise to keep it safe, to keep us growing, and to keep making you as happy 
            as you made me today.<br><br>
            Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.<br>
            You are my forever warmth, my steady glow, my always.
